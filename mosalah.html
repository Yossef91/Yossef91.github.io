              <h2>TheMarch of Muhammad Ali Clay Boxer></h2>
               <p>Muhammad Ali (1942-2016) was an American former heavyweight champion boxer and one of the greatest sporting figures of the 20th century. An Olympic gold medalist and the first fighter to capture the heavyweight title three times,
                    Ali won 56 times in his</p> 21-year professional career.In Muhammad, the World-Changer, Muhammad Jebara, historian and scholar of Semitic languages, provides a different account of Muhammad’s life and early years culled from extensive research into original sources. Keep in mind that, in common with other Semitic languages, Arabic words are mostly constructed from 3 or sometimes 4 letter roots,
                     each root providing the core meaning. Jebara’s findings indicate that the name Muhammad was given to him by his grandfather, Abd-Al-Muttalib. Abd-Al-Muttalib, the son of a Jewish mother and a father he didn’t remember, chose a name with “an archaic Semitic root, H-M-D, not commonly used in Mecca,” that meant ‘the exemplary one’
                      “so that his example would be exulted in the highest places and his name would come to be known among the nations.”
                      The root H-M-D, Jebara notes, “describes someone standing on an elevated platform who demonstrates actions to be emulated by onlookers.”
                      The prefix M that starts the name “transformed the root action described from something finite to something timeless…Muhammad describes a
                     constant state of doing, perpetually inspiring…others to emulate his example.” Ali’s outspokenness on issues of race, religion and politics made him a controversial figure during his career, and the heavyweight’s quips and taunts were as quick as his fists. 
                    Born Cassius Clay Jr., Ali changed his name in 1964 after joining the Nation of Islam. Citing his religious beliefs,
                    he refused military <p>induction and was stripped of his heavyweight championship  banned from boxing for three years during the prime of his career. Parkinson’s syndrome severely impaired Ali’s motor skills and speech,
                     but he remained active as a humanitarian and goodwill ambassador.</p>
