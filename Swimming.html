                    Swimming increases the flexibility of the muscles very much;
because of the use of almost all muscles of the body at the same time,
this is the opposite of what we do in the gyms ;
focusing on each muscle alone,
which ultimately lead to the extent of movement of muscles and thus narrowing muscle injury,
Swimming is also one of the exercises in which the elongation can be done.

                    The swimming extends the body parts as far as possible in each movement.
                    Swimming helps to control breathing,
                    which is often neglected by many,
                    with all its importance in all sports,
                    including muscle building or other sports.
                    Breathing is the way people get on the air to produce energy during their day and during exercise.
                    Swimming increase the amount of air that the lungs absorb, and improve breathing.
